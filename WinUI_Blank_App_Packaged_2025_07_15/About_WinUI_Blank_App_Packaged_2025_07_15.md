# About WinUI_Blank_App_Packaged_2025_07_15

This project is looking into why my regular app [testNmeaGpsParserWinUI](https://github.com/pedasmith/BluetoothDeviceController/tree/main/SmallProjects/TestNmeaGpsParserWinUI) doesn't compile in Release mode.



## Things tried

Created a WinUI Blank App (Packaged) project in Visual Studio 2022. Compiles fine.
Already supports WinUI3? How does one actually tell the difference between WinUI3 and WinUI2?
Added a WebView2 control and it works fine (note: but you have to build multiple times)



Todo:
Added NewtonSoft?
